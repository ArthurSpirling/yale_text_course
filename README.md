# An Introduction to Analyzing Political Texts
This repository has materials (code, data, slides) from my one day course at Yale University, on November 15, 2019. The course consists of a
* lecture component
* programming/applied component in (R)[https://www.r-project.org/]

The course requires absolutely *no* previous experience with working with texts.  But it *does* require some experience working with R.  In particular, you will get most out of the course if you have taken at least one undergraduate or graduate class that involved the use of R.

## Schedule
The schedule for the day is: 
* 10am-noon: Lecture
  * characterizing text
  * vector space model and "bag-of-words"
  * similarity measures
  * keywords in context
  * complexity/readability
  * uncertainty for texts
  * burstiness and style (time permitting)
* noon-1230pm: R exercises

* 1230--2pm: lunch

* 2-330pm: Lecture
  * Supervised learning: dictionaries/sentiment, "WordScores"
  * Unsupervised learning: Topic Models 
* 330pm--4pm: R exercises.
