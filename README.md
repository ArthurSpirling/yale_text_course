# An Introduction to Analyzing Political Texts
This repository has materials (code, data, slides) from my one day course at Yale University, on November 15, 2019. The course consists of a
* lecture component
* programming/applied component in [https://www.r-project.org/](R)

The course requires absolutely *no* previous experience with working with texts.  But it *does* require some experience working with R.  In particular, you will get most out of the course if you have taken at least one undergraduate or graduate class that involved the use of R.
