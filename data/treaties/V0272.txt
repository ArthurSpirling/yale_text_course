The said Miami Indians hereby cede and convey to the United States, all that certain tract of country set apart and assigned to the said tribe, by the article added by the Senate of the United States, by resolution of the date of February twenty-fifth, one thousand eight hundred and forty-one, to the treaty of November twenty-eighth, one thousand eight hundred and forty, and denominated among the amendments of the Senate as “Article 12,” which was assented to by said Indians, on the fifteenth day of May, one thousand eight hundred and forty-one; which tract is designated in said article as “bounded on the east by the State of Missouri, and on the north by the country of the Weas and Piankeshaws, on the west by the Pottowatomies of Indiana, and on the south by the land assigned to the New York Indians, estimated to contain five hundred thousand acres,” excepting and reserving therefrom seventy thousand acres for their future homes, and also a section of six hundred and forty acres for school purposes, to be selected and assigned to said tribe as hereinafter provided.

ARTICLE 2.

The United States shall, as soon as it can conveniently be done, cause the lands herein ceded and reserved, to be surveyed, as the Government lands are surveyed, the Miamis bearing the expense of survey of the reserved lands; and within four months after the approval of such surveys, each individual or head of a family of the Miami tribe, now residing on said lands, shall select, if a single person, two hundred acres; and if the head of a family, a quantity equal to two hundred acres for each member of the family; which selections shall be so made as to include in each case, as far as practicable, the present residences and improvements of each person or family, and, where it is not practicable, the selection shall fall on lands in the same neighborhood. And if, by reason of absence or otherwise, any single person, or head of a family, entitled to lands as aforesaid, shall fail to make his or her selection within the period prescribed, the chiefs of the tribe shall proceed to select the lands for those thus in default. The chiefs shall also select the six hundred and forty acres hereinbefore reserved for their school, to include the buildings erected for school purposes, and to embrace a sufficient portion of timber-land. After all of the before-named selections shall have been made, the said chiefs shall further proceed to select, in a compact body, and contiguous to the individual reservations, the residue of the seventy thousand acres accepted and reserved by the preceding article, which body of land shall be held as the common property of the tribe, but may, at any time, when the chiefs and a majority of the tribe request it, be sold by the President, in the manner that public lands of the United States are sold, and the proceeds, after deducting the expense of such sale, be paid to the tribe, under the direction of the President, and in such mode as he may prescribe: Provided, That if any single person or family entitled to land, shall have been overlooked, or wrongfully excluded, and shall make the fact appear to the satisfaction of the chiefs, such person or family may, with the approbation of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, receive their quantity, by the rule prescribed in this article, out of the tract to be thus selected and held as the common property of the tribe. All the selections herein provided for, shall, as far as practicable, be made in conformity with the legal subdivisions of United States lands, and immediately reported to the agent of the tribe, with apt descriptions of the same, and the President may cause patents to issue to single persons or heads of families for the lands selected by or for them, subject to such restrictions respecting leases and alienation as the President or Congress of the United States may impose; and the lands so patented shall not be liable to levy, sale, execution, or forfeiture: Provided, That the legislature of a State within which the ceded country may be hereafter embraced may, with the assent of Congress, remove these restrictions. When selections are so made, or attempted to be made, as to produce injury to, or controversies between, individuals, which cannot be settled by the parties, the matters of difficulty shall be investigated and decided on equitable terms, by the chiefs of the tribe, subject to appeal to the agent, whose decision shall be final.

ARTICLE 3.

In consideration of the cession hereinbefore made, the United States agree to pay to the Miami tribe of Indians the sum of two hundred thousand dollars, in manner as follows, viz: Twenty annual instalments of seven thousand five hundred dollars each, the first payable on the first day of October, one thousand eight hundred and sixty, and the remainder to be paid respectively on the first day of October of each succeeding year, until the whole shall have been paid; and the remaining fifty thousand dollars shall be invested by the President in safe and profitable stocks, the interest thereon to be applied, under his direction, for educational purposes, or such objects of a beneficial character, for the good of the tribe, as may be considered necessary and expedient; and hereafter, whenever the President shall think proper, the sum thus provided to be invested, may be converted into money, and the same paid to the tribe in such manner as he may judge to be best for their interests. No part of the moneys in this or the preceding article mentioned shall ever be appropriated or paid to the persons, families, or bands, who, by the fourteenth article of the treaty of November sixth, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight, by the fifth and seventh articles of the treaty of November twenty-eight, one thousand eight hundred and forty, or by virtue of two resolutions of Congress, approved March third, one thousand eight hundred and forty-five, and May first, one thousand eight hundred and fifty, or otherwise, are permitted to draw or have drawn, in the State of Indiana, their proportion of the annuities of the Miami tribe.

The Miami Indians of Indiana, being now represented in Washington by a fully authorized deputation, and having requested the foregoing amendments, the same are binding on them; but these amendments are in no way to affect or impair the stipulations in said treaty contained as to the Miamis west of the Mississippi, the said amendments being final, and not required to be submitted to the Miamis for their consent:

And the sum of two thousand two hundred dollars is hereby directed to be paid to the said Indians residing in the State of Indiana, for time employed and money expended in assisting to make this treaty, which may be paid to James T.

ARTICLE 9.

The said Indians promise to renew their efforts to prevent the introduction and use of ardent spirits in their country, to encourage industry, thrift, and morality, and by every possible means to promote their advancement in civilization.

The object of this instrument being to advance the interests of said Indians, it is agreed, if it prove insufficient, from causes which cannot now be foreseen, to effect these ends, that the President may, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, adopt such policy in the management of their affairs, as, in his judgment, may be most beneficial to them; or Congress may, hereafter, make such provision by law, as experience shall prove to be necessary.

ARTICLE 12.

It is agreed that the first instalment of the fourteen thousand two hundred and twenty-three dollars and fifty cents, mentioned in the fourth article, being the accumulation of the poor, infirm, and education fund, shall be applied, under the direction of the President, to purposes of education; and that a sufficient sum shall annually be set apart out of the payments to the Miamis west of Missouri, so long as any of the annuities herein provided for shall continue, to be expended under the direction of the chiefs, for the support of the poor and infirm, and for defraying any expenses of the tribe of a civil nature.
